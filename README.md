# Unity-GLSL-HLSL-Shaders
Messing around converting GLSL Shaders to HLSL Cg Unity Shaders. This project contains a sphere with reversed normals, and this custom HLSL Cg shader applied.
There is an additional XR Rig within the sphere to allow the end-user to look around and see an animated fluid shader.
